# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Alaska Fisheries Science Center Code of Conduct

As this repository is within the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center's GitHub Enterprise Organization,
the AFSC Code of Conduct is also applicable. The text below is taken from the AFSC Code of Conduct
(January 2023):

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) is committed to providing all staff a healthful, safe,
and respectful workplace. We consider staff to be inclusive of federal employees; affiliates like
contractors and grantees; volunteers; and anyone working in collaboration with AFSC in the
office, lab, or field. It is important to the success of our mission and the efficient functioning of
our Center that we treat one another with civility, dignity, and respect. As staff members of the
AFSC we represent the Federal government, and as such, we are held to, and desire to
promote, a high professional standard of behavior. It is important that we remember this whether
in the office, at a public event, or deployed in the field. To that end, we provide this Code of
Conduct for all staff. It is intended that this Code will facilitate a broader awareness of
expectations, and will help guide us all to be the best versions of ourselves and outstanding
representatives of the Federal government. This Code complements existing NOAA standards
for ethics, professionalism and scientific integrity that govern our work and AFSC work products.

AFSC staff members will...
* Treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of position or time in service.
* Respect everyoneâ€™s positions and duties, recognizing every role serves the mission of
the AFSC.
* Be honest, non-judgmental, and courteous.
* Act professionally in all situations.
* Empower colleagues to share ideas, provide feedback, and feel valued
through the promotion and intentional practice of psychological safety.
* Share in the responsibility for creating and maintaining a workplace free of
discrimination, harassment, and reprisal:
  * Never engage in discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion,
sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age,
physical or mental differences, or political views;
  * Never engage in any form of bullying or disrespect, including cyberbullying;
  * Never engagee in any form of sexual assault or sexual harassment.
* Report incidents of discrimination, harassment (including sexual harassment), bullying,
or disrespect in all our workplaces.

Finally, If You See Something, Say Something. Reports of any form of misconduct or
harassment can be submitted through any AFSC supervisor, the NOAA Workforce
Management Office or the NOAA Civil Rights Office.
